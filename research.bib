abstract="In order to derive in a convincing manner the formula of Goldberger and Treiman for the rate of charged pion decay, we consider the possibility that the divergence of the axial vector current in $\beta$-decay may be proportional to the pion field. Three models of the pion-nucleon interaction (and the weak current) are presented that have the required property. The first, using gradient coupling, has the advantage that it is easily generalized to strange particles, but the disadvantages of being unrenormalizable and of bringing in the vector and axial vector currents in an unsymmetrical way. The second model, using a strong interaction proposed bySchwinger and a weak current proposed byPolkinghorne, is renormalizable and symmetrical betweenV andA, but it involves postulating a new particle and is hard to extend to strange particles. The third model resembles the second one except that it is not necessary to introduce a new particle. (Renormalizability in the usual sense is then lost, however). Further research along these lines is suggested, including consideration of the possibility that the pion decay rate may be plausibly obtained under less stringent conditions.",
