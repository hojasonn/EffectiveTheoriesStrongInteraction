abstract="In order to derive in a convincing manner the formula of Goldberger and Treiman for the rate of charged pion decay, we consider the possibility that the divergence of the axial vector current in $\beta$-decay may be proportional to the pion field. Three models of the pion-nucleon interaction (and the weak current) are presented that have the required property. The first, using gradient coupling, has the advantage that it is easily generalized to strange particles, but the disadvantages of being unrenormalizable and of bringing in the vector and axial vector currents in an unsymmetrical way. The second model, using a strong interaction proposed bySchwinger and a weak current proposed byPolkinghorne, is renormalizable and symmetrical betweenV andA, but it involves postulating a new particle and is hard to extend to strange particles. The third model resembles the second one except that it is not necessary to introduce a new particle. (Renormalizability in the usual sense is then lost, however). Further research along these lines is suggested, including consideration of the possibility that the pion decay rate may be plausibly obtained under less stringent conditions.",

Several phenomenological investigations are discussed which aim at the identification of the scalar meson nonets of lowest mass and the super-numerous states if any. Results on the flavour structure of the light scalars f0(500),â€‰f0(980) and f0(1500) are presented; the evidence for f0(1370) is scrutinized. A significant surplus of leading clusters of neutral charge in gluon jets is found at LEP in comparison with MCs, possibly a direct signal for glueball production; further studies with more energetic jets at LHC are suggested. As a powerful tool in the identification of the scalar nonets or other multiplets, along with signals from glueballs we propose the exploration of symmetry relations for decay rates of C = +1 heavy quark states like Ï‡c or Ï‡b. Results from Ï‡c decays are discussed; they are not in support of a tetra-quark substructure of f0(980). A minimal scenario for scalar quarkonium-glueball spectroscopy is presented.}

    abstract = { Glueballs are particles whose valence degrees of freedom are gluons and therefore in their description the gauge field plays a dominant role. We review recent results in the physics of glueballs with the aim set on phenomenology and discuss the possibility of finding them in conventional hadronic experiments and in the Quark Gluon Plasma. In order to describe their properties we resort to a variety of theoretical treatments which include, lattice QCD, constituent models, AdS/QCD methods, and QCD sum rules. The review is supposed to be an informed guide to the literature. Therefore, we do not discuss in detail technical developments but refer the reader to the appropriate references. }

Above 1 GeV the states form a conventional qqÌ„ nonet mixed with the glueball of lattice QCD. Below 1 GeV the states also form a nonet, as implied by the attractive forces of QCD, but of a more complicated nature. Near the centre they are (qq)3Ì„(qÌ„qÌ„)3 in S-wave, with some qqÌ„ in P-wave, but further out they rearrange as (qqÌ„)1(qqÌ„)1 and finally as mesonâ€“meson states. A simple effective chiral model for such a system with two scalar nonets can be made involving two coupled linear sigma models. One of these could be looked upon as the Higgs sector of nonpertubative QCD.}

This addition allows for a remarkably good description of light scalar meson decays. The same effective Lagrangian produces a mixing of the lightest scalars with the positive parity qqÂ¯ states. Comparing with previous work where the qqÂ¯ mesons are identified with the nonet at 1200â€“1700 MeV, we find that the mixing required to fit the mass spectrum is in good agreement with the instanton coupling obtained from light scalar decays. A coherent picture of scalar mesons as a mixture of tetraquark states (dominating in the lightest mesons) and heavy qqÂ¯ states (dominating in the heavier mesons) emerges."

After a long time of uncertainty about the internal structure of the scalar mesons there now seems to be consistency which is in line with the major parts of experimental observations. Great progress has been made by introducing the unified model of Close and TÃ¶rnqvist. This model states that scalar mesons below 1 GeV may be understood as  in S-wave with some  in P-wave in the center, further out they rearrange as  and finally as mesonâ€“meson states. The P-wave component inherent in the structure of the neutral scalar mesons can be understood as a doorway state for the formation of the scalar meson via two-photon fusion, whereas in nucleon Compton scattering these P-wave components serve as intermediate states. The masses of the scalar mesons are predicted in terms of spontaneous and explicit symmetry breaking.}

Here we review both the recent and old experimental data and the model independent dispersive formalisms which have provided precise determinations of its mass and width, finally settling the controversy and leading to its new name: f0(500). We then provide a rather conservative average of the most recent and advanced dispersive determinations of its pole position sÏƒ=449âˆ’16+22âˆ’i(275Â±12). In addition, after comprehensive introductions, we will review within the modern perspective of effective theories and dispersion theory, its relation to chiral symmetry, unitarization techniques, its quark mass dependence, popular models, as well as the recent strong evidence, obtained from the QCD 1/Nc expansion or Regge theory, for its non ordinary nature in terms of quarks and gluons."

abstract = {Abstract This review of the quark-level linear σ model (QLLσM) is based upon the dynamical realization of the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons as a linear representation of SU(2)× SU(2) chiral symmetry, with the symmetry weakly broken by current quark masses. In its simplest SU(2) incarnation, with two non-strange quark flavors and three colors, this nonperturbative theory, which can be selfconsistently bootstrapped in loop order, is shown to accurately reproduce a host of low-energy observables with only one parameter, namely the pion decay constant f$\pi$. Extending the scheme to SU(3) by including the strange quark, equally good results are obtained for many strong, electromagnetic, and weak processes just with two extra constants, viz. fK and <π |Hweak|K>. Links are made with the vector-meson-dominance model, the BCS theory of superconductivity, and chiral-symmetry restoration at high temperature. Finally, these ideas are cautiously generalized to the electroweak sector, including the W, Z, and Higgs bosons, and also to CP violation.},

A symmetry-breaking mechanism is introduced by postulating that some of the vacuum expectation values of the scalar field operators do not vanish. The currents satisfy broken partial-conservation equations which agree with the postulates of the Cabibbo theory of weak interactions. They generate also, even when the Lagrangian is not invariant, a fullSU3{\texttimes}SU3 algebra. In order to induce a meson mass breaking, the existence of a nonlinear meson-meson interaction plays an important role. The observed values of the pseudoscalar meson masses enable one to calculate most of the meson-meson coupling constants and, then, to predict the masses of the scalar mesons.",

    abstract = { The Higgs boson was postulated in 1964, and phenomenological studies of its possible production and decays started in the early 1970s, followed by studies of its possible production in e+ e−, \$\bar pp\$ and pp collisions, in particular. Until recently, the most sensitive searches for the Higgs boson were at LEP between 1989 and 2000, which were complemented by searches at the Fermilab Tevatron. Then the LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS entered the hunt, announcing on July 4, 2012 the discovery of a "Higgs-like" particle with a mass of about 125 GeV. This identification has been supported by subsequent measurements of its spin, parity and coupling properties. It was widely anticipated that the Higgs boson would be accompanied by supersymmetry, although other options, like compositeness, were not completely excluded. So far there are no signs of any new physics, and the measured properties of the Higgs boson are consistent with the predictions of the minimal Standard Model. This article reviews some of the key historical developments in Higgs physics over the past half-century. }

It possesses a fermionic BRST-like symmetry, conserved for arbitrary$\Sigma$, and obeyingQ2=0. In a suitable version, the quantum ground states are the 1+1 dimensional Floer groups. The correlation functions of the BRST-invariant operators are invariants (depending only on the homotopy type of the almost complex structure ofM) similar to those that have entered in recent work of Gromov on symplectic geometry. The model can be coupled to dynamical gravitational or gauge fields while preserving the fermionic symmetry; some observations by Atiyah suggest that the latter coupling may be related to the Jones polynomial of knot theory. From the point of view of string theory, the main novelty of this type of sigma model is that the graviton vertex operator is a BRST commutator. Thus, models of this type may correspond to a realization at the level of string theory of an unbroken phase of quantum gravity.",

abstract = "The formulation of weak interactions by means of a current interacting with itself is generalized to the case in which T = 32 currents also exist, assuming the Î”T = 12 rule to be valid. Furthermore, generalizing the Feynman-Gell-Mann theory, it is postulated that all the currents entering the weak interactions are conserved in the limit of meson masses and baryon mass differences being neglected. This restriction limits the isotopic spin of the currents to T = 12, 1, and 32 if S = 2 currents are excluded. Another consequence of the same hypothesis is that parity mixtures are allowed for the T = 12 and T = 1 currents, but not for the T = 32 current. The five types of currents thus obtained (V and A currents with T = 12, 1 and only V or A with T = 32) can be combined into a 4 Ã— 4 matrix current |JÏ‡. It is shown that a weak Lagrangian proportional to the trace of |JÎ»â€ |JÎ» satisfies the Î”T = 12 rule. In the absence of neutral lepton currents the charged lepton current is necessarily incorporated in a rather unsymmetrical manner, but in conformity with the Î”T = 12 rule in strangeness changing leptonic decays. The scheme is applied to the decay of Î£ hyperons. In the pionic decay of Î£+, and in the lowest order in strong interactions, parity is conserved in the channel Î£+ â†’ n + Ï€+ and violated in the channel Î£+ â†’ Ï± + Ï€0 if all the five types of current are present. The phenomenological Lagrangian of Bludman for Î£ decay is obtained as a direct interaction from the terms of the weak Lagrangian. Finally, a model of a baryonmeson nonlinear interaction generalizing a previous model is given in which all the five types of conserved currents are shown to exist."

In the chiral limit, the masses are predicted to be mq = fπg, mπ = 0, mσ = 2mq, and we also find that the quark–meson coupling is \$g =2\pi /\sqrt{N\_c}\$, the three-meson coupling is \$g' =m\_\sigma^2 /2f\_\pi =2gm\_q\$ and the four-meson coupling is λ = 2g2 = g′/fπ, where fπ ≃ 90 MeV is the pion decay constant and Nc = 3 is the color number. By gauging this model one can generate the couplings to the vector mesons ρ and A1, including the quark–vector coupling constant gρ = 2π, gρππ, gA1ρπ and the masses mρ ~ 700 MeV, \$m\_{A\_1}\simeq \sqrt{3} m\_\rho\$; of course the vector and axial currents remain conserved throughout. }

The low-energy effective lagrangian we derive includes the usual pseudoscalar Goldstone modes, as well as the lower scalar, vector and axial-vector degrees of freedom. By taking appropriate limits, we recover most of the effective low-energy models discussed in the literature; in particular the gauged Yang-Mills vector lagrangian, the Georgi-Manohar constituent quark-meson model, and the QCD effective action approach model. Another property of the ensuing effective lagrangian is that it incorporates most of the short-distance relations which follow from QCD. (We derive these relations in the presence of all possible gluonic interactions to leading order in the 1Nc expansion.) Finally the numerical predictions are compared with the experimental values of the low-energy parameters."

All low energy parameters of the chiral lagrangian are expressed in terms of σ(p). In particular we obtain the ten coefficients of order p4 terms in the energy expansion.

by chiral symmetry. We derive a chiral Lagrangian of tensor mesons
in which the tensor mesons are treated as heavy non-relativistic matter 
fields. Using  1/Nc counting, we derive relations among unknown
couplings 
of the chiral Lagrangian. 
Chiral perturbation theory is applied to the tensor-meson mass matrix. 
At one-loop there are large corrections to the individual tensor
meson masses, but the singlet-octet mixing angle remains almost 
unchanged. We argue that all heavy mesons of spin   ⩾ 1 share common
feature of chiral dynamics.}

abstract = "Theoretical as well as experimental progress has been made in the last decade in describing the properties of baryons. In this review I will mostly report on the theoretical issues. Two non-perturbative methods are privileged frameworks for studying their properties in the low-energy domain: chiral perturbation theory, the effective field theory of the Standard Model at energies below 1 GeV and lattice QCD. I will mainly concentrate here on the first one but I will also discuss the complementarity of the two methods. Chiral extrapolations for lattice simulations of some nucleon properties will be investigated. I will then concentrate on processes involving at most two nucleons, describing for example pion–nucleon and pion–deuteron scattering, pion photo- and electro-production off the nucleon and the deuteron and doubly virtual Compton scattering. Three flavor calculations will also be reviewed."

Combined results from the nucleon and B∗-B mass-splitting sum rules give a result compatible with the standard value: 〈ψ̄ψ〉(1 GeV)≃(−229MeV)3, through the determinations of the quark-gluon mixed condensate. The vector form factor of the D→K∗lν semi-leptonic decay leads to the range 0.6≤〈ψ̄ψ〉/(−229MeV)3≤1.5. The upper limit combined with the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner (GMOR) relation implies the interesting lower bound on the sum of light quark masses:(mu+md)(1 GeV)≥ 9.4 MeV, which combined with the ratio of light quark masses from chiral perturbation theory leads to ms(1 GeV)≥(121±12) MeV. The lower limit combined with the positivity of the mq2 contribution to the GMOR relation leads to the upper bound : (mu+md)(1 GeV)≤ 15.7 MeV, which is independent on the nature of chiral symmetry breaking."

We emphasize the chiral SU(2) and SU(3) Lagrangians for the strong interactions of light mesons and discuss the theoretical and experimental input for determining the corresponding LECs. In the two-flavor sector, we review the knowledge of the LECs from both continuum fits and lattice QCD analyses. For chiral SU(3), next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) effects play a much greater role. Our main new results are fits of the LECs Li at both next-to-leading order (NLO) and NNLO, making extensive use of the available knowledge of NNLO LECs. We compare our results with available lattice determinations. We then discuss resonance saturation of LECs and the convergence of chiral SU(3) to NNLO. Finally, we review the status of predictions for the LECs of chiral Lagrangians with dynamical photons and leptons. }

The Ward identities of chiral symmetry determine the expansion up to and including terms of order p4 (at fixed ratio mquarkp2) in terms of a few constants, which may be identified with the coupling constants of a unique effective low energy Lagrangian. The low energy representation of several Green's functions and form factors and of the ππ scattering amplitude are then calculated. The values of the low energy coupling constants are extracted from available experimental data. The corrections of order Mπ2 to the ππ scattering lengths and effective ranges turn out to be substantial and the improved low energy theorems agree very well with the measured phase shifts. The observed differences between the data and the uncorrected soft pion theorems may even be used to measure the scalar radius of the pion, which plays a central role in the low energy expansion."

This Higgs boson mediates the generation of mass for elementary particles, including the mass of elementary (current) quarks. These current-quark masses leave 98\% of the mass of the atom unexplained. This large fraction is mediated by strong interaction, where instead of the Higgs boson the σ meson is the mediating particle. Though already introduced in 1957 by Schwinger, the σ meson has been integrated out in many theories of hadron properties because it had not been observed and was doubted to exist. With the observation of the σ meson in recent experiments on Compton scattering by the nucleon at MAMI (Mainz) it has become timely to review the status of experimental and theoretical researches on this topic.},,

The resonance contributions to the coupling constants of the O(p4) effective chiral lagrangian involving pseudoscalar fields only are determined. These low-energy coupling constants are found to be dominated by the resonance contributions. Although we do not treat the vector and axial-vector mesons as gauge bosons of local chiral symmetry, vector meson dominance emerges as a prominent result of our analysis. As a further application of chiral resonance couplings, we calculate the electromagnetic pion mass difference to lowest order in chiral perturbation theory with explicit resonance fields."

We find that Λ(δ0(KK)→γγ)≈0.6 keV, which is larger than the Crystal Ball measurement by a factor of ∼. This is a disagreement of ≈ 2α given current experimental or estimated theoretical errors. In contrast, the assignment δ=qq predicts a rate for and JADE collaborations for Λ(S∗→γγ) are consistent with our prediction for Λ(S∗(KK)→γγ), but are a factor of ∼5 smaller than the quark model prediction for Λ(S∗(qq)→γγ). We also discuss important uncertainties in our estimate of Λ((KK)→γγ) specifically (1) the value of ‖ψKK(0)‖, (2) use of the Born approximation to estimate the as yet unmeasured α(K+K-→γγ) near threshold and (3) the possibility of large isospin violation effects in the S∗–δ0 system. Possible ways of improving on our approximations are successed."

abstract = "The applicability of the quasi-static approximation for calculating the two-photon annihilation rate of the scalar f0(980) meson envisaged as a KK¯ molecule is critically re-examined. It is shown that the validity of this approximation depends on the detailed interplay between the momentum dependence of the annihilation amplitude and the momentum space transform of the bound state wavefunction of the annihilating pair. The approximation becomes invalid when these two scales of variation are similar. An improved method of calculation based on the inclusion of electromagnetic corrections to the kernel of the Bethe–Salpeter equation for the interacting KK¯ pair is outlined to cover this case and applied to re-evaluate the two-photon decay width for f0(980) in a one-boson exchange model for the interkaon interaction. The corrections are significant and result in a much better agreement with experiment."

abstract="We carry out an exploratory study of the isospin one a0(980) and the isospin one-half $\kappa$ scalar mesons using Nf= 2 + 1 + 1 Wilson twisted mass fermions at one lattice spacing. The valence strange quark is included as an Osterwalder-Seiler fermion with mass tuned so that the kaon mass matches the corresponding mass in the unitary Nf= 2 + 1 + 1 theory. We investigate the internal structure of these mesons by using a basis of four-quark interpolating fields. We construct diquark-diquark and molecular-type interpolating fields and analyse the resulting correlation matrices keeping only connected contributions. For both channels, the low-lying spectrum is found to be consistent with two-particle scattering states. Therefore, our analysis shows no evidence for an additional state that can be interpreted as either a tetraquark or a tightly-bound molecular state.",

From the data, meson trajectories in these planes are approximately linear and have a universal slope. A detailed discussion of the scalar meson sector is given for which, based on a recent K-matrix analysis, the nonet classification of quark–antiquark states places two scalar nonets — the basic nonet and that of the first radial excitation — in the range below 2000 MeV. Two isospin 0 scalar states — the broad resonance f0(1200–1600) and the light σ-meson — do not fit into the quark–antiquark classification, i.e., are exotic. The ratios between the coupling constants for hadronic decays to the ππ, K, ηη and ηη' states point to the gluonium nature of the broad state f0(1200–1600).}

abstract = "We review the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) approach to the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). After a general overview of the nonperturbative aspects of OCD, we introduce the NJL model as a low-energy effective theory of QCD. The collective nature of hadrons and the constituent quark model are treated in a unified way. Various aspects of QCD related to the dynamical and explicit breaking of chiral symmetry and the axial anomaly can be well described. The subjects treated in part I include the vacuum structure of QCD, mass spectra and coupling constants of hadrons, flavor mixing in mesons, the violation of the OZI rule in baryons, and the validity of the chiral perturbation in QCD. It is shown that a subtle interplay between the axial anomaly and the current-quark masses plays important roles, and a realistic evaluation of the strangeness and heavy quark contents of hadrons is given. Also the problem of elusive scalar mesons is studied in detail. For a pedagogical reason, we first present an account of basic ingredients and detailed technical aspects of the NJL model using simple versions of it. In part II, the NJL model is applied to the system at finite temperature (T) and density (ϱ) relevant to the early universe, interior of the neutron stars and the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. After a brief introduction of the field theory at finite temperature, phenomena associated with the restoration of chiral symmetry in the medium are examined. The subjects treated here include the quark condensates in the medium, meson properties at finite T (ϱ) and their experimental implications. A special attemtion is paid to fluctuation phenomena near the critical temperature, i.e., possible existence of soft modes in the scalar channel and a jump of the quark-number susceptibility in the vector channel."

In the chiral limit, the masses are predicted to be mq = fπg, mπ = 0, mσ = 2mq, and we also find that the quark–meson coupling is \$g =2\pi /\sqrt{N\_c}\$, the three-meson coupling is \$g' =m\_\sigma^2 /2f\_\pi =2gm\_q\$ and the four-meson coupling is λ = 2g2 = g′/fπ, where fπ ≃ 90 MeV is the pion decay constant and Nc = 3 is the color number. By gauging this model one can generate the couplings to the vector mesons ρ and A1, including the quark–vector coupling constant gρ = 2π, gρππ, gA1ρπ and the masses mρ ~ 700 MeV, \$m\_{A\_1}\simeq \sqrt{3} m\_\rho\$; of course the vector and axial currents remain conserved throughout. }

abstract="Path integral techniques in collective fields are shown to be a useful analytical tool to reformulate a field theory defined in terms of microscopic quark (gluon) degrees of freedom as an effective theory of collective boson (meson) fields. For illustrations, the path integral bosonization approach is applied to derive a (non)linear $\sigma$ model from a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) quark model. The method can be extended to include higher order derivative terms in meson fields or heavy-quark symmetries. It is also approximately applicable to QCD.",

	abstract = {The historical development of the Nambu–Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model is briefly reviewed. The SU(2) × SU(2) and U(3) × U(3) local quark NJL models are considered. The mechanisms responsible for spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and vector dominance are exhibited. The local NJL model is adequate in describing the mass spectrum and the strong and electroweak decay modes of the four ground-state meson nonets: pseudoscalar, scalar, vector, and axial-vector. The applicability of the model to mesons in a hot dense medium is discussed. It is shown that solving problems related to the description of meson radial excitations and quark confinement requires the nonlocal extension of the NJL model. The primary emphasis of this review is on the methods that are used in various versions of the NJL model. The reader is referred to the cited works for what these models predict in low-energy hadron physics.}

This map allows us to explain the different qualitative behaviour between even and odd ladders, in exactly the same way as it explains the difference between integer and half-integer spin chains. Namely, for even ladders the topological term in the sigma model action is absent, while for odd ladders the  parameter, which multiplies the topological term, is equal to , where S is the spin of the ladder. Hence even ladders should have a dynamically generated spin gap, while odd ladders with half-integer spin should stay gapless and physically equivalent to a perturbed  Wess - Zumino - Witten model in the infrared regime. We also derive some consequences from the dependence of the sigma model coupling constant on the ladder Heisenberg couplings constants.}

We will give a short introduction to chiral perturbation theory for mesons and will discuss, as an example, the electromagnetic polarizabilities of the pion.

Next we will turn to the one-baryon sector of chiral perturbation theory and will address the issue of a consistent power counting scheme. As examples of the heavy-baryon framework we will comment on the extraction of the axial radius from pion electroproduction and will discuss the generalized polarizabilities of the proton. Finally, we will discuss two recently proposed manifestly Lorentz-invariant renormalization schemes and illustrate their application in a calculation of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors.",

The combination of differential cross-section data with polarized photon asymmetries allows to determine a complete set of s- and p-wave amplitudes at threshold for the photoproduction case. These extracted amplitudes are in good agreement with predictions and fits of Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory. On the other hand, new data on pion electroproduction shows a significant deviation from the predicted cross-sections at a four-momentum transfer of Q2 = 0.05 GeV2/c2. For the coherent pion production from the deuteron the photoproduction data agree with Chiral Perturbation Theory. The former reported severe disagreement between the electroproduction s-wave amplitude at a four-momentum transfer of Q2 = 0.1 GeV2/c2 and first calculations seems to be resolved now.",
