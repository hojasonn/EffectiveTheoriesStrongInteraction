abstract="In order to derive in a convincing manner the formula of Goldberger and Treiman for the rate of charged pion decay, we consider the possibility that the divergence of the axial vector current in $\beta$-decay may be proportional to the pion field. Three models of the pion-nucleon interaction (and the weak current) are presented that have the required property. The first, using gradient coupling, has the advantage that it is easily generalized to strange particles, but the disadvantages of being unrenormalizable and of bringing in the vector and axial vector currents in an unsymmetrical way. The second model, using a strong interaction proposed bySchwinger and a weak current proposed byPolkinghorne, is renormalizable and symmetrical betweenV andA, but it involves postulating a new particle and is hard to extend to strange particles. The third model resembles the second one except that it is not necessary to introduce a new particle. (Renormalizability in the usual sense is then lost, however). Further research along these lines is suggested, including consideration of the possibility that the pion decay rate may be plausibly obtained under less stringent conditions.",

Several phenomenological investigations are discussed which aim at the identification of the scalar meson nonets of lowest mass and the super-numerous states if any. Results on the flavour structure of the light scalars f0(500),â€‰f0(980) and f0(1500) are presented; the evidence for f0(1370) is scrutinized. A significant surplus of leading clusters of neutral charge in gluon jets is found at LEP in comparison with MCs, possibly a direct signal for glueball production; further studies with more energetic jets at LHC are suggested. As a powerful tool in the identification of the scalar nonets or other multiplets, along with signals from glueballs we propose the exploration of symmetry relations for decay rates of C = +1 heavy quark states like Ï‡c or Ï‡b. Results from Ï‡c decays are discussed; they are not in support of a tetra-quark substructure of f0(980). A minimal scenario for scalar quarkonium-glueball spectroscopy is presented.}

    abstract = { Glueballs are particles whose valence degrees of freedom are gluons and therefore in their description the gauge field plays a dominant role. We review recent results in the physics of glueballs with the aim set on phenomenology and discuss the possibility of finding them in conventional hadronic experiments and in the Quark Gluon Plasma. In order to describe their properties we resort to a variety of theoretical treatments which include, lattice QCD, constituent models, AdS/QCD methods, and QCD sum rules. The review is supposed to be an informed guide to the literature. Therefore, we do not discuss in detail technical developments but refer the reader to the appropriate references. }

Above 1 GeV the states form a conventional qqÌ„ nonet mixed with the glueball of lattice QCD.

Near the centre they are (qq)3Ì„(qÌ„qÌ„)3 in S-wave, with some qqÌ„ in P-wave, but further out they rearrange as (qqÌ„)1(qqÌ„)1 and finally as mesonâ€“meson states. A simple effective chiral model for such a system with two scalar nonets can be made involving two coupled linear sigma models. One of these could be looked upon as the Higgs sector of nonpertubative QCD.}

This addition allows for a remarkably good description of light scalar meson decays. The same effective Lagrangian produces a mixing of the lightest scalars with the positive parity qqÂ¯ states. Comparing with previous work where the qqÂ¯ mesons are identified with the nonet at 1200â€“1700 MeV, we find that the mixing required to fit the mass spectrum is in good agreement with the instanton coupling obtained from light scalar decays. A coherent picture of scalar mesons as a mixture of tetraquark states (dominating in the lightest mesons) and heavy qqÂ¯ states (dominating in the heavier mesons) emerges."

After a long time of uncertainty about the internal structure of the scalar mesons there now seems to be consistency which is in line with the major parts of experimental observations. Great progress has been made by introducing the unified model of Close and TÃ¶rnqvist. This model states that scalar mesons below 1 GeV may be understood as  in S-wave with some  in P-wave in the center, further out they rearrange as  and finally as mesonâ€“meson states. The P-wave component inherent in the structure of the neutral scalar mesons can be understood as a doorway state for the formation of the scalar meson via two-photon fusion, whereas in nucleon Compton scattering these P-wave components serve as intermediate states. The masses of the scalar mesons are predicted in terms of spontaneous and explicit symmetry breaking.}

Here we review both the recent and old experimental data and the model independent dispersive formalisms which have provided precise determinations of its mass and width, finally settling the controversy and leading to its new name: f0(500). We then provide a rather conservative average of the most recent and advanced dispersive determinations of its pole position sÏƒ=449âˆ’16+22âˆ’i(275Â±12). In addition, after comprehensive introductions, we will review within the modern perspective of effective theories and dispersion theory, its relation to chiral symmetry, unitarization techniques, its quark mass dependence, popular models, as well as the recent strong evidence, obtained from the QCD 1/Nc expansion or Regge theory, for its non ordinary nature in terms of quarks and gluons."
